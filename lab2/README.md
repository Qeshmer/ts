#Lab 2 - Calculator
Now and then even web app users need to add one or two numbers, so why not write a calculator using TypeScript 
and jQuery? Is should work as the desktop applications that are typically bundled with desktop operating systems.
Start out by implementing the simple use cases, add, multiply, divide and subtract.

The project has lite-server as a dependency, you can run the server by:
 ```
>npm start
 ```  
and check out the page on ``http://localhost:3000/``.

## Extras
* Make it handle expressions like 3*(7-4)+1
* Build a [RPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) calculator
* Make it handle algebraic expressions like HP calculators pioneered (see [HP 28](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-28_series)) - hey now you 
are on you way to implement a symbolic calculation package, maybe go all the way with 
  [Maple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple_(software)) or [Mathematica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram_Mathematica) 
  for the web?
