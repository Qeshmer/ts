# Lab 4 
 This lab is based on the Angular 2 "Tour of Heroes" example, see [ToH](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/).
 While marvelling over the ingenuity and richness of Angular 2, you realize something 
 really strange: the dashboard's display of top heroes is rather ad hoc. You decide to enhance 
 the application:
 
 * Users should be able to vote on their favourite heroes
 * The dashboard's hero display should be based on who has the most votes
 
 As the other labs there are npm scripts to compile, run tests, run a lite-server and more.
