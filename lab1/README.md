#Lab 1 - A Collections Library for the Enterprise Developer
One of the TypeScript selling points is that is supposed to appeal to the "enterprise developer". Hey, you think, 
let's give them what they want: a TypeScript implementation of the Java collections library. You figure that this 
 something that can be sold for plenty of dollares to those dev organizations, kicking off your start up 
  on a nice path. If it crashes and burns you can open source the code and enjoy the open source fame.
  
 
## Extras
 
 * Some say that functional is the way to go, and Java has some. A full streams implementation 
 is probably tricky, but some is straightforward, like a ```map()``` function that applies a lambda 
  on all elements and returns a new collection with the transformed values. And so on, loads of fun!
  
 
 If Java collections is not your bag, try the equivalent in .NET.
